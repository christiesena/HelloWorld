Hello! My name is Christie and I live in Rhode Island.
I have a cat neamed Duck and a dog named Brody.


final assignment

let numberToWord = prompt("Pick 1 or 2")
if (numberToWord === "1") {
  console.log("That number is One")
}else{
  console.log("That Number is Two")
}

I THINK THIS IS SO WRONG :(
